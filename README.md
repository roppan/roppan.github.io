PROJECTS
Pay-To-Play (Project 1)
https://github.com/dinomolina/NBAstats_Project
Recently completed a project in a team of three using data sets from 2017 – 2018 NBA players Statistics, Used Python, Pandas, Java Scrip, and Flask to visualize how NBA Player are measured by efficiency rating to earn top dollars. The team came up with an equation to determine how Player Efficiency Rating (PER) can be calculated. Points + Rebound + Assist + Steals + Blocks – Missed Field Goals – Missed Free Throws ¬– Turnovers / the number of Games a player played in the season = (PER) and used scatter plots and quartile ranges for analysis. By using a consistent scale, it was possible to put all three variables on the same graph by gathering statistics on individual players averages, quartile ranges and identified outliers. Strengths including analytical problem-solving abilities combined with collaborating across diverse groups, makes me a valuable addition to any team.
